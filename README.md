# Thread Management System using Priority Scheduling

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a **Priority Scheduling Algorithm** used in Operating Systems
to manage multiple threads and allocate CPU time efficiently.

Each thread is assigned a priority:
Low, Medium, High, or Critical.
Higher priority threads get CPU time first.

---

## ⚙️ Key Concepts
- Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)
- Thread States: Running, Paused, Stopped
- Round Robin for same priority
- CPU Time Allocation

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- React.js
- TypeScript
- Operating System Scheduling Concepts

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
- Difference between thread and process
- Priority-based CPU scheduling
- Starvation problem and aging technique
- Practical implementation of OS concepts
